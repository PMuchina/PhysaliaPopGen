This workshop provides an introduction to demographic modelling, through different approches, including inferences of effective population sizes (smc++ & GONE), as well as the Approximate Bayesian Computation approach implemented in DILS.<br>
Main instructor: Thibault Leroy (<i>thibault.leroy_at_inrae.fr</i>)

Note that the R scripts that will be used with the "Rscript [script.R]" function are also available here, in case you would like to download them. <br>
In case you have any problem, downloading the results from DILS from the physalia-cluster, you could download one or few tar.gz files here (https://github.com/ThibaultLeroyFr/SeqApiPop_WGShoneybeeDataReanalysis/tree/main/DILS_analysis/DILS_allgenome), ideally use those with "noSFS" and "constantNe".<br>
